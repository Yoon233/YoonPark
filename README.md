**'Enjoy Learing Process'**

Hi, I’m Yoon. I recently moved to Canada from South Korea and am currently in high school here. I’m really into programming and am learning C++ right now. I’m also interested in exploring diverse technologies, such as cloud and hardware. The tech world is vast and full of possibilities, and I’m excited to dive into new areas and discover what ignites my passion. Ultimately, I hope to use these technologies to make positive changes in the world. In my spare time, I enjoy running with my friends and listening to various kinds of music. I’m always open to new experiences. Nice to meet you!
